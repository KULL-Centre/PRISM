Interesting notes and resources
--------------------------------

Pfam:
- pdb files not up-to-date

Future:
- include [SIFTS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/), [ID mapping](https://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/)
- get pdbs despite their domains
- add [InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) for comparison
- add PP interactions (https://www.uniprot.org/help/interaction_section)
